This is a small library that focuses on the following things as well as a couple of utility functions to make my live easier:

- Custom map markers and map decorations.

- Soft fluid system: a virtual fluid system that goes ontop of forge ones designed to work well in conjunction with vanilla mechanics and items.
   Its base measurement unit is the minecraft bottle, as opposed to 1000 minecraft bucket used by the forge system, and easily allows modders to add support for different fluid      container items such as bowls, bottles and whatnot.
